# postlight / learn

A collection of resources for learning common engineering skills and tools used at [Postlight](https://postlight.com).

## How to Use This Resource

The educational resources listed here are hands-on and interactive. As you learn new skills, use them to complete real-world tasks and publish your work.

### First, fork it.

Fork this repository. Once you've completed the GitHub section, create a new branch in your fork, and commit the code you write as you go.

### Second, use your Git skills.

Once you've completed your Git training you will be ready to start branching, committing, and creating pull requests to your own fork. You will only need to do this for the trainings that require you to write code. For other trainings (such as git-it and How To NPM) you will create separate repos as instructed in the workshop.

* Training Module
  * Create a branch for the training.
  * Create a separate folder in the repository to store your code.
* Training Exercises
  * Commit each exercise to the branch.
  * Consider each exercise a new feature.
  * Other commits should follow Postlight's commit style.
* Finished?
  * Check off the boxes on the list of the README.md.
  * When your done push your branch to your fork.
  * Create a Pull Request to your own fork (not the original repo).
  * Add your mentor as a reviewer.

### Finally, put it all together.

Once you have completed the training you can put it to practice to see how far your skills have evolved. Apply what you have learned by either revamping the code-challenge submission or writing an application from scratch that demonstrates the skills learned.
