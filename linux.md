## Preparations

Learning about Linux and how to use it is essential for an engineer today. Should you be on Windows you can use the [Linux Subsystem on Windows](https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/) or a Virtual Machine of your choice. Mac users should be able to use their own native shell.
